# Software required
Eagle

# Procedure
1.Open a new schematic file within your project.</br>
2.Use the libraries provided in EAGLE or create custom libraries if necessary.</br>
3.Place components onto the schematic sheet by using the 'Add' tool.</br>
4.Connect the components using the 'Net' tool.</br>
5.Label nets appropriately to ensure clarity</br>
6.Once routing is complete, perform a ERC to ensure there are no errors and save the schematic.</br>
7.Click on the 'Generate/Switch to Board' icon to create a board from your schematic.</br>
8.EAGLE's board layout editor allows you to place components, route traces, and define board shapes.</br>
9.Arrange components on the board to optimize space usage and minimize signal interference.</br>
10.Route traces to connect components according to your schematic.</br>
11.Use the various routing and editing tools provided by EAGLE to ensure proper routing and avoid design rule violations.</br>
12.Once routing is complete, perform a design rule check (DRC) to ensure there are no errors and save the board layout.</br>
13.Go to File > CAM Processor and set up CAM jobs to generate Gerber files for your PCB layers.</br>
14.Verify generated files to ensure they contain all necessary information.</br>
15.Save the generated manufacturing files.</br>

# Theory

Detection Stage: The circuit typically begins with a sensor, like a smoke detector or a heat sensor, which detects the presence of fire or excessive heat in the environment.

Sensor Activation: When the sensor detects smoke or heat beyond a certain threshold, it sends a signal to the fire alarm circuit indicating the potential presence of a fire hazard.

Signal Processing: The circuit processes the signal received from the sensor to determine if it surpasses the preset threshold for triggering an alarm.

Activation of Alarm: If the signal surpasses the threshold, the circuit activates the alarm system. This could be in the form of audible alarms such as sirens, bells, or horns, as well as visual indicators like flashing lights or LEDs.

Power Supply: The circuit is powered by a stable power supply, ensuring continuous operation even during power outages, often backed up by batteries or a secondary power source.

Alert Transmission: In more sophisticated setups, the fire alarm circuit may be connected to a central monitoring station or control panel, which alerts authorities or building occupants to the potential fire emergency.

### Working 

A fire alarm circuit typically consists of a sensor, such as a smoke detector or heat sensor, which detects the presence of fire or excessive heat. When triggered, the sensor sends a signal to the circuit, which activates an alarm system comprising audible and visual indicators. These indicators alert occupants to evacuate the premises immediately. The circuit is powered by a stable power supply, often backed up by batteries, ensuring continuous operation. In more advanced setups, the circuit may be connected to a central monitoring station for further action. After the alarm is triggered and the fire threat addressed, the circuit resets itself for future detection. Regular maintenance and testing are crucial for ensuring the circuit's reliability in safeguarding lives and property.
